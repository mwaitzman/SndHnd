# SndHnd
 SndHnd is an alternative Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) focusing on music composition and synthesis as opposed to live recording.  The name "SndHnd" is a combination of two retro abbreviations:  "Snd" which was a common abbreviation for the MacOS Sound Manager in MacOS application source code circa 1984-1994, and "Hnd" which was a common abbreviation for a handle in MacOS application memory management source code circa 1984-1994.  SndHnd is a microtonal timbre generator that grew out of an example on the book "QuickTime for Java: A Developer's Notebook".  Though originally written for the Macintosh platform, SndHnd was re-hosted to Linux upon predictions of Apple Computer replacing the Macintosh with the iPad (a platform that doesn't support most software development) as an outgrowth of the so-called "post-PC" era of computing.
